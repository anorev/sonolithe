A sound puzzle game where you play as a space traveler, who, after an accident, is stuck in a cave where a strange sound mechanism seems to be the only way out. 

Prototype designed by Victor Soulié, Marie Gelix, Angèle Bappel, Robin Verona & Pierre Martinière during a two weeks project at Gobelins, the image school. Made with Unity.
